## Overview
 
Analysis of weather (temperature and precipitation) at a location in Oahu to help an investor determine whether to invest in a surf shop.  The code is written with intent to repurpose for other locations if desired.  With a sqlite file as a database, this analysis imports the ORM functionality of SQLAlchemy for querying purposes and performs an analysis in Jupyter Notebook and displays results using Flask framework.

## Exploratory Analysis

At first glance, querying to pandas DF and plotting the precipitatioin by day, we notice there is a fair amount of precipitation.

However, upon further investigation, we notice several reportings for each day.

Furthermore, upon querying a count of distinct weather station ids, we note 9 existing stations, all actively reporting rainfall accumulation.

Although there are varying counts of station reports per day, we can look at the average per day.  It's important we don't consider the sum of precipitatioin due to station count fluctuations.

Next, we look at min, max, and average temperatures for the most active station 'USC00519281'.

With a little more granularity, a histogram will provide us with more insight about frequency of reported temps.

    # Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plot the results. 
    #Starting from the last data point in the database. 
    prev_year = dt.date(2017,8,23)

    # Calculate the date one year from the last date in data set.
    prev_year = dt.date(2017,8,23) - dt.timedelta(days=365)

    # Perform a query to retrieve the data and precipitation scores
    results = list() #variable to store query
    results = session.query(Measurement.date, Measurement.prcp).filter(Measurement.date >= prev_year)

    # Save the query results as a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column
    df = pd.DataFrame(results, columns=['date','precipitation'])
    df.set_index(df['date'], inplace=True)

    # Sort the dataframe by date
    df = df.sort_index()

    # Use Pandas Plotting with Matplotlib to plot the data
    df.plot()
    plt.ylabel("Rainfall (inches)")
    plt.xlabel("Date")
    plt.title("Total Precipitation by Day")
    plt.xticks(rotation=90)

## Results

- Temperature
    - June and December have strikingly similar statistics which indicates that the temperature is fairly stable throughout the year without any major fluctuations as reflected in the mean, min, and max.  The results are favorable for investing.

- Precipitation
    - Both June and December have records reporting rainfall for most days of the month although small, half of the days being under a tenth of an inch.  75 percent of the days have around one one hundredth of an inch which could mean cloud cover.

- These two major weather observations are in conflict with each other.  One suggests good temperature range and stability which means potential for higher activity in the area.  The other suggests maybe it's not so sunny all that often.  Perhaps there's a bit more cloud cover than surfers and ice cream connaisseurs would prefer.


## Conclusion

Depending on larger climate patterns indicating time of day, I suggest carefully considering temperature and rainfall in regards to an investment decision.  If rain is later in the day, maybe it's not a big deal.  If it's cloudy and drizzling all day, maybe this location is not so good for a surf and icecream shop.  An analysis digging deeper into these questions is definitely possible.  It would require a different data set as this one is without time stamp.  With time stamps and multiple reportings per day, one could analyze hourly reports.  Also, I would recommend looking into some foot traffic data including tourism and nearby towns and distances.  This would give us an idea for how many customers we could reach and translate into sales.  Furthermore, from a surfing perspective, it's important to look at tide and swell and the type of terrain near the beach.  It would be helpful to collect data on how many surfers visit this area on a daily basis.
